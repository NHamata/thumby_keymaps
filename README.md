# Thumby Keymap

### Philosophy
Named the thumby (since it sounds like thumb-e). There are a few core design philosphies for thumby keymaps:
- Utilize the thumbs on most commonly used keys, to achieve this...
  - 'e' is assigned to a thumb key
  - 'space' is assigned to a thumb key
  - 'commonly used modifiers are assigned to thumb keys'
- minimize layer changes by...
  - leveraging combos (a.k.a chords), that are easy to execute and DO NOT contort your hand in an uncomfortable way. Most combos utilize only home row, and the key below the index finger home row as well as the key below the pinky finger home row
  -  Leverage tap dancing. Use a combination of double/triple taps to get different symbols or actions. Tap dancing is generally done on letters of the english language that do not have natural words with doubles, such as the letter 'j', any letter that has words with double letters are avoided, or circumvented by using the triple tap (or more) to access the new function.
  - Generally there are a total of 1-3 layers. 2 layers is the goal, as this constricts the design to be more home row, and comfortable key reach heavy.
- Completely remove any need to contort your hands with modifiers. Most modifier actions (e.g. ctrl+c, alt+c) require your hand to contort in an uncomfortable way. If you use hotkeys alot this can be a source of strain. To remove this almost all mods are one shot taps. If a mod is required to be held down, it should be placed on a thumb key, or to the left of the pinky.

### Usage
- The hex files are already provided and you can simply upload them to your device via qmk.
- If you do not trust my hex file, pull the keymaps, compile and upload the firmware yourself.
- All maps will work with the most current stable QMK release, as I personally use them myself

### Future...
I will be making keymaps for other common split ergo boards once I am able to get and build them, maybe the kyria, lily58, sofle, ergodash. I would also like to apply this philosophy to default qwerty keyboards as well, 40% keyboards seem to be the best fit.
