# Thumby Keymap

### Philosophy
This keymap is named the thumby (since it sounds like thumb-e). Its was designed to be used with ergonomic split keyboards and uses an alternative layout. There are a few core design philosphies for thumby keymaps:
- Utilize the thumbs on most commonly used keys, to achieve this...
  - 'e' is assigned to a thumb key.
  - 'space' is assigned to a thumb key (this is a given)
  - 'commonly used modifiers are assigned to thumb keys'
- Restrict the design to two layers to cover all the keys on a full sized keyboard. 
- A third layer can be used but it should be for macro's or functionality beyond a regular full sized keyboard.
- use the home row or adjacent keys comfortable to reach as much as possible. 
- The keymap must be designed such that your hand must not contort in an uncomfortable way during use.
- Combos (a.k.a chords) must be mostly based around the home row, if commonly used. All combos must be comfortable to execute, no awkward hand yoga.
- Tap dancing should only be used in letters that do not have a natural double in your language AND are on keys that are not commonly used
- (Optional but recommended) Utilize an alternative layout, so it is more comfortable to type and since 'e' is moved to the thumbs.
- Completely remove any need to contort your hands with modifiers. All mods are one shot taps.

### Alternative Layout and Ergo Splits
I highly recommend trying a alternate layout for a split ergonomic board with non standard stagger, for some reason it is easier to seamlessly switch between an ergonomic split keyboard with an alternative layout, and a regular qwerty, as opposed to a regulary qwerty keyboard with two different layouts. Maybe its because the designs are so different that your muscle memory doesn't really associate one with the other, I don't know. When it comes to split ergo boards I use an alternative layout which is a modification of the colemak mod dh, that basically moves a few keys to account for 'e' now being a thumb key. after some trial and error I have found that this modifidation maintains the overall feel and spirit of colemak with minimal changes. I based it off colemak because it is really popular alternative layout, and I find rolling keys more natural than alternating hands for dvorak.

### Usage
- The hex files are already provided and you can simply upload them to your device via qmk.
- If you do not trust my hex file, pull the keymaps, compile and upload the firmware yourself.
- All maps will work with the most current stable QMK release, as I personally use them myself

### Future...
I will be making keymaps for other common split ergo boards once I am able to get and build them, maybe the kyria, lily58, sofle, ergodash.
